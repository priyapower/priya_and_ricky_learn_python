[Beginning to Code Section](#Beginning-to-Code-the-Project)

[Final Code Section](#The-Final-Leg-of-Code)

1. We are going to build a GUI calculator (it looks a lot like the calculator preloaded in the system!) [resource](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/)
2. Old Concept: GUI
  - Graphical User Interface
  - Even thought we love web and mobile applications, there is still a need to traditional desktop applications!
3. New Concept: [PyQT](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro)
  - Python library
  - It is a "python binding for Qt"
  - Qt is a framework written in `C++`
  - From RealPython: "a set of C++ libraries and development tools that include platform-independent abstractions for Graphical User Interfaces (GUI), as well as networking, threads, regular expressions, SQL databases, SVG, OpenGL, XML, and many other powerful features. "
  - We are working with **PyQt5** in this tutorial
4. #### The Setup for this Project
  - Let's install PyQt, the [docs](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/installation.html#building-and-installing-from-source) if you are "building from source"
  - You can also use `binary wheels`. [Resource for Understanding](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/)
    - To summarize: wheels are components that help make package installation faster and more stable
  - Since we are okay with system-wide installation (not worrying about virtual environments right now)
  - Since we have Pyton 3.5 and later, we can use our package manager pip: CLI `pip3 install pyqt5`
  - Got back `Successfully installed PyQt5-sip-12.8.1 pyqt5-5.15.2`
5. Create our first PyQt Application (Starting with that "Hello World")
  - [Download](https://realpython.com/bonus/pyqt-calculator/) source code for use throughout tutorials
  - Create a directory (I am in Coding/learning/python/gui_calculator)
  - Inside your project directory, create (touch) a file, `hello.py`
    - Step 1: Import [QApplication](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/api/qtwidgets/qapplication.html)
    - Step 1: Import required [PyQt 5.0 Widgets](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/api/qtwidgets/qtwidgets-module.html)
    ```py
    """Simple Hello World example with PyQt5.""" # understanding the triple quotes (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/triple-quotes-in-python/)
    # Handles the exit status of the application
    import sys #The sys module provides information about constants, functions and methods of the Python interpreter. (https://www.python-course.eu/sys_module.php)
    # Step 1. Import `QApplication` and all the required widgets
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication # manages the GUI applications control flow and main settings. Contains the main event loop (where all events from the window system and other sources are processed and dispatched)
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QLabel # Used for displaying text or an image. No user interaction functionality is provided.
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget # The base class of ass user interface object. It can receive mouse, keyboard, or other events from the window system & paint a represenation of itself on the screen
    ```
  - Step 2: Create an instance of QApplication
    - Add the following code to `hello.py`
    ```py
    # Step 2: Create an instance of QApplication
    app = QApplication(sys.argv) #Deals with initializatoin and gives you access to command line arguments
            # sys.argv contains the list of command-line arguments passed into a Python script. If your application is not going to accept command line arguments, then you can use an empty list instead of sys.argv. That is, you can do something like app = QApplication([]).
    ```
  - Step 3: Create an instance of your application's GUI
    - Add the following code to `hello.py`
    ```py
    # Step 3. Create an instance of your application's GUI (we are using QWidget)
    window = QWidget() # set a global? variable 'window' to an executable version of QWidget
    window.setWindowTitle('PyQt5 App') # sets the title bar (https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwidget.html#top-level-and-child-widgets)
    window.setGeometry(100, 100, 280, 80) # sets the geometry of the widget, relative to its parent and excluding the window frame (https://docs.huihoo.com/qt/3.3/qwidget.html#setGeometry)
            # define the size of the window and where to place it
            # .setGeometry(x, y, w, h)
            # x and y coordinates which define where the window is placed
            # w and h determine the actual width and height of the window
    window.move(60, 15) # Sets the position of the widget within its parent widget (https://docs.huihoo.com/qt/3.3/qwidget.html#move)
            # .move(x, y)
            # Defines placement in the window
    helloMsg = QLabel('<h1>Hello World!</h1>', parent=window) # sets a variable that executes QLabel and makes a header on the parent window
    helloMsg.move(60, 15) # Set the position of helloMsg
    # NOTES
        # To avoid memory leaks, you should always make sure that any QWidget object has a parent, with the sole exception of top-level windows.
        # parent-child: A widget that doesnâ€™t have a parent is a main window or a top-level window; A widget that has a parent (which is always another widget) is contained (or shown) within its parent.
    ```
  - Step 4: Show your application's GUI
    - Add the following code to `hello.py`
    ```py
    # Step 4. Show your application's GUI
    window.show() # Adds a new event to the application's event queue; shows the widget and all its children
            # if size or position has changed, this ensures move and resize has opens before it is shown
    ```
  - Step 5: Run your application's event loop (or main loop)
    - Add the following code to `hello.py`
    ```py
    # Step 5. Run your application's event loop (or main loop)
    sys.exit(app.exec_()) # The exec() call starts the event-loop and will block until the application quits. If an exit code has been set, exec() will return it after the event-loop terminates. It is good practice to pass on this exit code to sys.exit() - but it is not strictly necessary. Without the explicit call to sys.exit(), the script will automatically exit with a code of 0 after the last line of code has been executed. A non-zero exit code is usually used to inform the calling process that an error occurred.
    ```
  - Step 6: #SuccessKidMemeGoesHere
    - CLI: `python3 hello.py`
    - Running this script opens a cute [window!](https://files.realpython.com/media/hello.066635a13824.png), mine even came through on dark mode! => black bg white txt
  - Step 7: Celebrate your success! You did it - you've created your first PyQt GUI desktop application
  - ![image](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/AggressiveWebbedCormorant-small.gif)
6. Code style
  - [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) Convention
    - Written by Guido van Rossum (the original author of Python), alone with Barry Warsaw (known for work with Python and GNU Mailman, and Nick Coghlan (known for work with Python and founding the PyCon Australia Education Seminar)
    - Good [resource](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/#naming-styles) for understanding and seeing naming convention with examples
  - PyQt Convention
    - Since this was built on top of Qt (and that was written in C++), it uses camelCase in naming convention **which we will follow and use in this project**
7. #### Understanding PyQt
  - Basics of PyQt (let's get the building blocks figured out so we can build our house), [direct link](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/#learning-the-basics-of-pyqt)
  - [Widgets](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/#widgets):
    - Rectangular-shaped graphical components
    - Examples: Buttons, Labels, Line Edits (Forms), Combo boxes (drop downs), Radio buttons, ETC
  - [Layout managers](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/#layout-managers):
    - You _CAN_ use `.resize()` and `.move()` to arrange sets of widgets to create a GUI that is "coherent and functional"
    - However, this means manual calculations, further calculations for the **resize event**, and you will have to update all calculations if you make changes to your layout or change widgets
    - SO... Use **Layout Managers**
    - Classes that allow you to place your widgets where you need them in whatever size you'd like
    - This also means that on a **resize event**, the widgets are automatically adjusted
    - **Practice Example Horizontal** (new file: `h_layout.py`):
    ```py
    """Horizontal layout example."""
    import sys
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QHBoxLayout # Lines up widgets horizontally (layout manager)
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QPushButton # Provides a command button (widget)
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget
    app = QApplication(sys.argv) # Initializer
    window = QWidget() # Executable widget
    window.setWindowTitle("QHBoxLayout") # sets window title
    layout = QHBoxLayout() # Executable layout manager
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Left")) # adds a widget to the manager that is a button titled 'Left'
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Center")) # adds a widget to the manager that is a button titled 'Center'
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Right")) # adds a widget to the manager that is a button titled 'Right'
    window.setLayout(layout) # sets the layout made above
    window.show() # allows it to show
    sys.exit(app.exec_()) # Executes the event loop until the window is closed
    ```
    - Run it with `python3 h_layout.py`
    - [Look](https://files.realpython.com/media/h-layout.3471b0b63bc8.png) at that pretty, **click-able** application!
    - **Practice Example Vertical** (new file `v_layout.py`):
    ```py
    """Vertical layout example."""
    import sys
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QPushButton
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QVBoxLayout # # Lines up widgets vertically (layout manager)
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = QWidget()
    window.setWindowTitle("QVBoxLayout")
    layout = QVBoxLayout() # Makes an executable variable using the Vertical Layout Manager Class
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Top")) # Top button
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Center"))
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Bottom"))
    window.setLayout(layout)
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
    ```
    - Run it with `python3 v_layout.py`
    - [Look](https://files.realpython.com/media/v-layout.366271060ab3.png) at the result :)
    - **Practice Example Grid** (new file `g_layout.py`):
    ```py
    """Grid layout example."""
    import sys
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QGridLayout # Imports the Grid Layout Manager class
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QPushButton
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = QWidget()
    window.setWindowTitle("QGridLayout")
    layout = QGridLayout() # Here is the grid class manager
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Button (0, 0)"), 0, 0) # The String defines the title of the button; # The Integers define the position
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Button (0, 1)"), 0, 1)
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Button (0, 2)"), 0, 2)
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Button (1, 0)"), 1, 0)
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Button (1, 1)"), 1, 1)
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Button (1, 2)"), 1, 2)
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Button (2, 0)"), 2, 0)
    layout.addWidget(QPushButton("Button (2, 1) + 2 Columns Span"), 2, 1, 1, 2) # The integers here represent 2 column span - but why isn't it: 2, 1, 2, 2?. when I experimented and put that in, it brought the double span button a little further down the grid (off kilter with button (2,0))
    window.setLayout(layout)
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
    ```
    - Run it with `python3 g_layout.py`

    """Form layout example."""
    import sys
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QFormLayout # Imports the form layout manager class
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QLineEdit # Widget that allows for text editable sections (aka, the form)
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = QWidget()
    window.setWindowTitle("QFormLayout")
    layout = QFormLayout() # Executable form class
    layout.addRow("Name:", QLineEdit()) # Adds labeled forms
    layout.addRow("Age:", QLineEdit())
    layout.addRow("Job:", QLineEdit())

    - Main Window-Style Application: `QMainWindow`, a typical desktop application
    - Dialog-Style Application: `QDialog`, more like a form window - fill this out and submit
    - **Example Dialog** (new file `dialog.py`):
    ```py
    """Dialog-Style application."""
    import sys
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication

    ```
    - Run it with `python3 main_window.py`
    - [Look](https://files.realpython.com/media/main-window-app.53142a356307.png) at the result :)
  - [Applications](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/#applications)
    - The most basic class
    - `QApplication` controls the flow as well as its main settings
    - Some responsibilities include:
      - Handling initialization and finalization
      - Providing the event loop and event handling
      - Handling most of the system-wide and application-wide settings
      - Providing access to global information, such as the applicationâ€™s directory, screen size, and so on
      - Parsing common command-line arguments
      - Defining the applicationâ€™s look and feel
      - Providing localization capabilities
    - **Most Important:** It handles the event loop and the entire event handling mechanism
  - [Event loops](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/#event-loops)
    - Gui application are event-drive - which meaas that the functions and methods are exectued in response to user actions, aka events(click button, select item, entering text, pressing keys, etc)
    - Events are handles by the event loop (or main loop)
    - Event loops are infinite in which events are processed and dispatched
    - Event loops work until the application is terminated
    - Because of historical syntax (see Python2 having `exec` keyword), you can use both `.exec()` ** `.exec_()` with Python3
  - [Signals and slots](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/#signals-and-slots)
    - If events are the actions, widgets are the action/event-catchers
    - In response to an event, a widget will emit a **signal** (signal = a message that announces a change in state)
    - This signal will _NOT_ perform an action
    - To trigger an action, connect it to a **slot** (slot = performs the action whenever the signal is emitted)
    - Python callbacks can be slots
    - **Example Signals and Slots** (new file `signals_slots.py`)
    ```py
    """Signals and slots example."""
    import sys
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QLabel
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QPushButton
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QVBoxLayout
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget
    def greeting(): # create greeting(), which youâ€™ll use as a slot.
        """Slot function."""
        if msg.text():
            msg.setText("")
        else:
            msg.setText("Hello World!")
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    window = QWidget()
    window.setWindowTitle("Signals, and Slots")
    layout = QVBoxLayout()
    btn = QPushButton("Greet")
    btn.clicked.connect(greeting)  # Connect clicked to greeting() # connect the buttonâ€™s clicked signal to greeting()
    layout.addWidget(btn)
    msg = QLabel("")
    layout.addWidget(msg)
    window.setLayout(layout)
    window.show()
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
    ```
    - Call it with `python3 signals_slots.py`
    - [Look](https://files.realpython.com/media/signals-slots.5c631f0ce2cc.gif) here for result :)
    - **Example PARTIALS for Signals and Slots** (new file `signals_slots_partial.py`
    ```py
    """Signals and slots example."""
    import functools # For this code to work, you need to import functools first (the partial language)
    import sys

8. #### Beginning to Code the Project
  - Creating a Calculator with Python and PyQt, [direct link](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/#creating-a-calculator-with-python-and-pyqt)
  - Initial Notes:
    - We are using MVC here
    - A step-by-step of our future MVC pattern interacting with out GUI Application:
      - The user performs an action or request (event) on the view (GUI).
      - The view notifies the controller about the userâ€™s action.
      - The controller gets the userâ€™s request and queries the model for a response.
      - The model processes the controller query, performs the required operations, and returns an answer or result.
      - The controller receives the modelâ€™s answer and updates the view accordingly.
      - The user finally sees the requested result on the view.
    - **We are using the above pattern for our GUI Calculator**
  - [Make a Skeleton:](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/#creating-the-skeleton)
    - In your project, make a new file `pycalc.py` (Side note: I moved all my practice files into a folder labelled practice so that pycalc.py is at the root of the gui_calculator folder)
    - Input the following code
    ```py
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    # Above is a 'shebang line' => which defines where the interpreter is located
    """PyCalc is a simple calculator built using Python3 and PyQt5."""
