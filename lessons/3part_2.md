### Part 1
------
#### Setup
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- Following [this tutorial](https://dev.to/paurakhsharma/flask-rest-api-part-0-setup-basic-crud-api-4650)
- Create your project folder/directory: `mkdir practice_api_movies`
- `cd practice_api_movies`
- Create a new virtual environment
- Successful installation of pipenv, includes errors
  - tried `pip install --user pipenv`, error = 'no command pip'
  - tried `pip3 install --user pipenv` and got a correct sequence, however, could not use `pipenv` still
  - Finally tried `sudo -H pip install -U pipenv` ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46391721/pipenv-command-not-found))
- Use `pipenv install flask` to install flask
- The following prints out
    ```console

    To activate this project's virtualenv, run pipenv shell.
    Alternatively, run a command inside the virtualenv with pipenv run.
    ```
- There should be **2** new files in your project directory, `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` (confirmed)
- My `Pipfile` contains the packages (**flask** package is on ln 7) - which means if someone else downloads this code and uses `pipenv install` they should get **flask** as well, similar to a `requirements.txt` file:
    ```console
    [[source]]
    url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
    verify_ssl = true
    name = "pypi"

    [packages]
    flask = "*"

    [dev-packages]

    [requires]
    python_version = "3.9"
    ```

#### Get your Root endpoint Exposed
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- Make a file for our rest api: `touch app.py`
- Code for the app file:
    ```python
    # imports the flask class from the flask package
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    # Defines the root endpoint (@app.route == decorator)
    @app.route('/')
    # When '/' endpoint is called, it returns this function, hello()
    def hello():
      # which returns {'hello': 'world'}
      return {'hello': 'world'}

    # This line starts the flask server
    app.run()
    ```
- To **RUN** the app, you first enable the virtual environment with `pipenv shell`
- Response:
    ```console
    /Users/priyapower/Coding/learning/python/practice_api_movies  $üêßpipenv shell
      Launching subshell in virtual environment...
        . /Users/priyapower/.local/share/virtualenvs/practice_api_movies-8EKfv0js/bin/activate
    /Users/priyapower/Coding/learning/python/practice_api_movies  $üêß
      . /Users/priyapower/.local/share/virtualnvs/practice_api_movies-8EKfv0js/bin/activate
    (practice_api_movies) /Users/priyapower/Coding/learning/python/practice_api_movies  $üêß
    ```
- Run with `python app.py`
- Response:
    ```console
    * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
    * Environment: production
     WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
     Use a production WSGI server instead.
    * Debug mode: off
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```
- Checked at http://localhost:5000 OR http://127.0.0.1:5000/
- Confirmed site response was `{'hello': 'world'}`
- Yay! Everything is up an running

#### Let's get an index of movies returned
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- Time to update our `app.py` "runner" file:
    ```python
    # Imports jsonify from flask package. This converts our data into proper JSON responses
    from flask import Flask, jsonify

    app = Flask(__name__)

    #  creates a data set called movie which is an array. Each element in the array represents a movie data record that is a hash/dict datatype. Name datatype is string. Casts and Genres datatypes are arrays of strings.
    movies = [
      {
        "name": "The Shawshank Redemption",
        "casts": ["Tim Robbins", "Morgan Freeman", "Bob Gunton", "William Sadler"],
        "genres": ["Drama"]
      },
      {
       "name": "The Godfather ",
       "casts": ["Marlon Brando", "Al Pacino", "James Caan", "Diane Keaton"],
       "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"]
      }
    ]

    # Updates the endpoint beyond just / and now has a declared endpoint /movies
    @app.route('/movies')
    def hello():
      # returns the JSON version of the movie data set from line 7
      return jsonify(movies)

    app.run()
    ```
- Tested at http://127.0.0.1:5000/movies and http://localhost:5000/movies
  - From this point, all testing will be done directly through localhost since 127.0.0.1 represents localhost
- Now that we know our endpoint is exposing data correctly and through JSON, time to check it with **Postman**
![Get on Postman](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103389126-2e907380-4aca-11eb-8949-9ea100449747.png)
- Woo! It works

#### CRUD, It's what you do
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- For pop reference, see [example commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxcsKE1SS4Y) and [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VERB_(program)
- Time to work on that CRUD (create, read, update, and destroy, see this [article](https://trendintech.com/2018/01/19/why-is-crud-so-important-in-computer-programming/) for more information on CRUD)
- Updates to code:
    ```python
    # Imports request object from flask, see here(https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/reqcontext/)
    from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
      return {'hello': 'world'}

    # This is called a list in python (array in ruby/js)
    movies = [
      {
        "name": "The Shawshank Redemption",
        "casts": ["Tim Robbins", "Morgan Freeman", "Bob Gunton", "William Sadler"],
          "genres": ["Drama"]
      },
      {
       "name": "The Godfather ",
       "casts": ["Marlon Brando", "Al Pacino", "James Caan", "Diane Keaton"],
       "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"]
      }
    ]

    @app.route('/movies')
    def get_all_movies():
      return jsonify(movies)

    # CREATE
    # @app.route can take 2 arguments, the first being the endpoint, the second is the API verb (get, post, put, delete, etc). I assume without the second arg, the default is GET since the beginning of this tutorial worked :)
    @app.route('/movies', methods=['POST'])
    # New method/function name
    def add_movie():
      # set block variable movie equal to the json input (from user/client)
      movie = request.get_json()
      # Takes the movies list(what I know as array from ruby) from line 10 and adds an item (in this case, the block variable movie which has saved the user/client input in json format) to end of the list (https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/append)
      movies.append(movie)
      # returns dict/hash of id which is set to calling the length of the list (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp) && returns a status code of 200 - successful
      return {'id': len(movies)}, 200

    # UPDATE
    # endpoint now has an integer index value it is assuming exists in the list
    @app.route('/movies/<int:index>', methods=['PUT'])
    def update_movie(index):
      movie = request.get_json()
      # replaces what is saved at the index value with the information from user/client input
      movies[index] = movie
      # returns the json version of the record at that index spot && status code 200
      return jsonify(movies[index]), 200

    # DESTROY
    @app.route('/movies/<int:index>', methods=['DELETE'])
    def delete_movie(index):
      #  removes element at index (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_pop.asp)
      movies.pop(index)
      # returns an string of none with 200 status code
      return 'None', 200

    app.run()
    ```

#### Test CRUD out with Postman
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- Create/Post:
  - Post verb
  - Body tab = raw & JSON
  - Put user/client info for a NEW movie record in the body input section
  - Hit Send
  - VOILA! - You can confirm with /movies as a GET to see all 3 movie records
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103389125-2e907380-4aca-11eb-9f11-c0c748ada3b8.png)
- Update/Put:
  - Put verb
  - Body tab = raw & JSON
  - Paste new info
  - Hit send
  - **ERROR** - I attempted to do /movies/3, since there are 3 records, however, it is technically id=2 because it begins at 0. Is there a discrepancy in the code? Why does POST show id=3?
  - VOILA!
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103389124-2df7dd00-4aca-11eb-8eb4-41ebb4b3fa2f.png)
- Destroy/Delete:
  - Ensure correct id in endpoint uri
  - Delete verb
  - Hit send
  - VOILA!
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103389122-2d5f4680-4aca-11eb-99d0-0f3abee0cf08.png)

#### Part 1 Final Code
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
  ```py

    movies.append(movie)
    return {'id': len(movies)}, 200

  @app.route('/movies/<int:index>', methods=['PUT'])
  def update_movie(index):
    movie = request.get_json()
    movies[index] = movie
    return jsonify(movies[index]), 200

  @app.route('/movies/<int:index>', methods=['DELETE'])
  def delete_movie(index):
    movies.pop(index)
    return 'None', 200

  app.run()
  ```

### Part 2
------
#### Installing Mongodb and Understanding the library we will use
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- The docs for installing on [mac](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
- Prereqs: xcode command-line & homebrew
- "Tap" the homebrew mongodb by running `brew tap mongodb/brew`
- My terminals output:
```console
==> Tapping mongodb/brew
Cloning into '/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/mongodb/homebrew-brew'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 1, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
remote: Total 504 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 503
Receiving objects: 100% (504/504), 106.55 KiB | 1.13 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (238/238), done.
Tapped 11 formulae (39 files, 179.2KB).
```
- We need to download the community edition, so first check system reqs by running `brew tap | grep mongodb`
- I confirmed in my terminal that I see `mongodb/brew`
- Install the community edition (latest version is at 4.4) by running `brew install mongodb-community@4.4`
- See lots of output including:
```console
==> Installing mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
==> Caveats
To have launchd start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community now and restart at login:
  brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
==> Summary
üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb-community/4.4.3: 11 files, 156.8MB, built in 4 seconds
```
- Popular Libraries:
  - [Pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) - connects Mongo and Python
    - Allows you to use the schemaless nature of MongoDB
  - [MongoEngine](http://docs.mongoengine.org) - creates a _document_ based schema that connects Python and Mongo
    - This will **restrict** our access to the schemaless nature of MongoDB
    - We will utilize an extension for flask called [Flask-MongoEngine](http://docs.mongoengine.org/projects/flask-mongoengine/en/latest/)
- Installing the libraries and the Flask extension
  - Since MongoEngine relies on PyMongo, if you [install](http://docs.mongoengine.org/guide/installing.html) engine, it brings pymongo along with it
  - And guess what?? Since flask-mongoengine relies on mongoengine, when you install flask you get mongoengine!
  - So we really only need to start with the extension since the rest come with it
  - Run `pipenv install flask-mongoengine`
  - To confirm pymongo installed, I ran `pip freeze | grep pymongo`, which returned `pymongo==3.11.2`
  - To confirm mongoengine installed, I ran `pip freeze | grep mongoengine` , which returned `mongoengine==0.22.1`
  - To confirm the extension installed, I ran `pip freeze | grep flask-mongoengine` , which returned `flask-mongoengine==1.0.0`

#### Getting started with the database
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- First we begin my updating our file tree
  - `mkdir database`
  - `cd database`
  - `touch db.py`
  - `touch models.py`
- We need to activate the database
  - Inside `db.py`, add the following code:
  ```py
  # imports flask_mongoengine from mongoengine
  from flask_mongoengine import MongoEngine
  # sets a variable called db to the engine
  db = MongoEngine()
  # Function will initialize the database using the app (app.py) as its arg
  def initialize_db(app):
    # initializes the database with the app
      db.init_app(app)
  ```
- We need to add a Movie model
  - Inside `models.py`, add the following code:
  ```py
  # This is a 'document'
  # This defines the schema and users/clients cannot work outside these constraints
  from .db import db
  # Makes a Movie document
  class Movie(db.Document):
    # has three fields
    # name is a string datatype that is required and must be unique
    name = db.StringField(required=True, unique=True)
    # casts is a list datatype; has a subfield of string that is required
    casts = db.ListField(db.StringField(), required=True)
    # genres is a list datatype; has a subfield of string that is required
    genres = db.ListField(db.StringField(), required=True)
  ```

#### Connect your database with your app
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- Update  `app.py` to use the database and not hardcoded data && change the view functions
  ```py
  # remove jsonify from flask imports and add a Response import
  from flask import Flask, request, Response
  # Brings in the function we just wrote in db.py
  from database.db import initialize_db
  # Brings in the class (document) we just wrote in models.py
  from database.models import Movie
  import json

  app = Flask(__name__)
  # Sets up configuration for mongodb
  app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {
    # declare the host in the format <host-url>/<database-name> (see http://docs.mongoengine.org/projects/flask-mongoengine/en/latest/#configuration)
    'host': 'mongodb://localhost/practice-api-movies'
  }

  # initialize the database
  initialize_db(app)

  @app.route('/movies')
  def get_movies():
    # calls all the objects from the Movie document & converts to json
    movies = Movie.objects().to_json()
    # returns a response object, response type is defined as application/json
    return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

  @app.route('/movies', methods=['POST'])
  def add_movie():
    # gets the json from the body in post
    body = request.get_json()
    # loads the Movie document with the fields in the request
    # the ** is a spread operator (in this case it will spread the dict object)
    # After it will save
    movie =  Movie(**body).save()
    # block variable id is set to movie.id
    id = movie.id
    # returns block variable of string of the id and status 200
    return {'id': str(id)}, 200

  @app.route('/movies/<id>', methods=['PUT'])
  def update_movie(id):
    body = request.get_json()
    # First get the movie object by id, THEN update with spread
    Movie.objects.get(id=id).update(**body)
    # Returns empty string and 200 status
    return '', 200

  @app.route('/movies/<id>', methods=['DELETE'])
  def delete_movie(id):
    # First get the movie object by id, THEN delete
    movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id).delete()
    return '', 200

  app.run()
  ```

#### Make our API endpoints more robust
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
  - We forgot a CRUD endpoint. We have Create (Post), Read/Retrieve (GET), Update (Put), and Destroy (Delete). HOWEVER, Read/Retrieve technically has 2! GET single movie (in rails this is Show) and GET all movies (in rails this is Index). We are missing our GET single (get by id)
  - Add the following _above_ `app.run()`
  ```py
  @app.route('/movies/<id>')
  def get_movie(id):
    movies = Movie.objects.get(id=id).to_json()
    return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)
  ```

#### Run the server and test in Postman
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- If you are outside of the virtual environment, first run `pipenv shell`
- Otherwise, just run `python app.py`
- If there are no typos, you should see your server start
- To continue testing, we may need to ensure database is connected and loaded with data (see next section)

#### Add data to database
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- _For data see below with [options 1 & 2](#options)_
- Exit the server (CTRL + C on Mac)
- First, we need to see if we have truly started mongodb.
  - Run `brew services list`.
  - Is `mongodb-community` labeled as _started_ or _stopped_?
    - If started, great, move to next bullet.
    - If not, run `brew services start mongodb-community@4.4` (change version if need to, or use without version)
- Now that mongodb is started:
  - I ran my server first (In terminal `python app.py`)
  - And confirmed my Postman could "hit" the endpoints
  - I ran POST with faker data and then ran GET to confirm at least 2 endpoints were exposed and working correctly
- We can always interact with the database using Postman, **but what if I want to interact with the db using my terminal?**
  - In terminal, run `mongo` to enter the database shell
  - Run `show dbs` to see your databases (_my project db didn't show up until I had run the server and connected via Postman - maybe this was a fluke or a misconception on my part_)
  - Run `use <project-db-name>`; for me this was `use practice-api-movies`
  - The response from terminal was `switched to db practice-api-movies`
  - FUN FACT ABOUT MONGO: _If this db didn't exist before, it will create it right here!_
  - Commands:
    ```python
    # db is a command
    # foo = <collection-name> (in our project it would be movie)

    # DROP:
    db.dropDatabase()`

    # INSERT single:
    db.foo.insert({
      "attribute": "information",
      "attribute": "information"
    })

    # INSERT multi:
    db.foo.insert([
      {
        "attribute": "information"
      },
      {
        "attribute2": "information2"
      }
    ])

    # GET all:
    db.foo.find()
    # GET all, pretty:

- #### Options
- Option 1 for adding data via `Postman`
  ```py
  # Movie Record 1
  POST http://localhost:5000/movies
  # In the body tab, using raw & JSON
  {
    "name": "The Shawshank Redemption",
    "casts": ["Tim Robbins", "Morgan Freeman", "Bob Gunton", "William Sadler"],
    "genres": ["Drama"]
  }
  # Click Send

  # Movie Record 2
  POST http://localhost:5000/movies
  # In the body tab, using raw & JSON
  {
    "name": "The Godfather ",
    "casts": ["Marlon Brando", "Al Pacino", "James Caan", "Diane Keaton"],
    "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"]
  }
  # Click Send

  # Confirm movies in database
  GET http://localhost:5000/movies
  # Click Send
  ```
- Option 2 for adding data via `Mongo Shell`
  ```py
  # In Mongo Shell, so run `mongo` in terminal

  # See your databases
  show dbs

  # Use a specific database (FUN FACT: if it doesn't exist already, it will also create it)
  use practice-api-movies # use <your-project-or-database-name>

  # If you need to drop a database

  # Insert multiple records
  db.movie.insert([
    {
      "name": "The Shawshank Redemption",
      "casts": ["Tim Robbins", "Morgan Freeman", "Bob Gunton", "William Sadler"],
      "genres": ["Drama"]
    },
    {
      "name": "The Godfather ",
      "casts": ["Marlon Brando", "Al Pacino", "James Caan", "Diane Keaton"],
      "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"]
    }
  ])

  # Confirm your records
  db.movie.find().pretty()
  ```
- At this point you have successfully added data to your database using mongo shell (terminal) or using Postman and can test each of your CRUD endpoints via Postman! Celebrate!

#### Best Practices for Organizing Code
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- See [here](https://exploreflask.com/en/latest/organizing.html) for official Flask documentation on organizing code
- [Flask Community](https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/2626) conversation on MVC, factory patterns, and folder/tree structure
- [Blue Ocean Tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-structure-large-flask-applications) on flask structures (though, take this with a grain of salt)

#### Blueprints
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- What are [blueprints](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24420857/what-are-flask-blueprints-exactly) in flask?
  - [Official Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/blueprints/)
  - Simply put, it is a way to structure your code; a method of encapsulating code into separate components; a chance for Single-Responsibility Principle patterns to emerge!
    - Why is SRP important - smaller chunks of code that only do "one thing" makes code easier to read, easier to understand and implement. It allows us to test easier since each "chunk of code" won't have too much logic or know too much about other parts of code.
    - What is encapsulation? We hide the code/data; The only access to this code will be through our other bits of code (in this project, we will pull the routes information for Movie into it's own file and the only only "public" file that has access will be our `app.py`, aka our runner file)
- So let's take our project code and encapsulate the code!
- From the root of the project folder:
  - `mkdir resources`
  - `cd resources`
  - `touch movie.py`
- Update `movie.py` with all the movie routes
  ```py
  @app.route('/movies/<id>')
  def get_movie(id):
    movies = Movie.objects.get(id=id).to_json()
    return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

  @app.route('/movies')
  def get_movies():
    movies = Movie.objects().to_json()
    return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

  @app.route('/movies', methods=['POST'])
  def add_movie():
    body = request.get_json()
    movie =  Movie(**body).save()
    id = movie.id
    return {'id': str(id)}, 200

  @app.route('/movies/<id>', methods=['PUT'])
  def update_movie(id):
    body = request.get_json()
    Movie.objects.get(id=id).update(**body)
    return '', 200

  @app.route('/movies/<id>', methods=['DELETE'])
  def delete_movie(id):
    movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id).delete()
    return '', 200
  ```
- Your clean `app.py` now looks like:
  ```py
  from flask import Flask, request, Response
  from database.db import initialize_db
  from database.models import Movie
  import json

  app = Flask(__name__)

  app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {
    'host': 'mongodb://localhost/practice-api-movies'
  }

  initialize_db(app)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

  app.run()
  ```
- **HOWEVER**, we aren't quite finished. The routes are encapsulated in their own file, but our `app.py` file has no way of accessing it or understanding what the `movie.py` file is.
- Update `movie.py` to import Blueprints for flask and update code for use of blueprint:
  ```py
  # gets Blueprint (the new package) as well as Response and request from Flask
  from flask import Blueprint, Response, request
  # Pulls in the class Movie from our models file
  from database.models import Movie

  # creates a local variable movies which will be a blueprint
  # Blueprint has 2 arguments: Blueprint(name, import_name); where import_name is typically `_name_` because this is a special Python variable that represents the name of the current module
  movies = Blueprint('movies', _name_)

  # We no longer call @app.route, but use movies.route (our blueprint)
  movies.route('/movies/<id>')
  def get_movie(id):
    movies = Movie.objects.get(id=id).to_json()
    return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

  movies.route('/movies')
  def get_movies():
    movies = Movie.objects().to_json()
    return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

  movies.route('/movies', methods=['POST'])
  def add_movie():
    body = request.get_json()
    movie =  Movie(**body).save()
    id = movie.id
    return {'id': str(id)}, 200

  movies.route('/movies/<id>', methods=['PUT'])
  def update_movie(id):
    body = request.get_json()
    Movie.objects.get(id=id).update(**body)
    return '', 200

  movies.route('/movies/<id>', methods=['DELETE'])
  def delete_movie(id):
    movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id).delete()
    return '', 200
  ```
- Now that our encapsulated file of `movie.py` is officially a blueprint, we can update our runner (`app.py`) to access the blueprint for Movie
- Update `app.py` to register the Blueprint:
  ```py
  # We no longer need request and Response (since this is inside movie.py)
  from flask import Flask
  # We still need our database
  from database.db import initialize_db
  # We no longer call our model directly (since this is inside movie.py), instead, we call on movies variable from the resource file movie.py
  from resources.movie import movies

  app = Flask(__name__)

  app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {
    'host': 'mongodb://localhost/practice-api-movies'
  }

  initialize_db(app)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

  # We use a blueprint for the movies routes
  app.register_blueprint(movies)

  app.run()
  ```
- Now, it looks much cleaner and feels closer to single-responsibility principle patterns

#### Flask RESTful
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- We aren't quite finished though
- [Official Extension Documentation](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- This extension encourages best practices in RESTful design
- Install in virtual environment, `pipenv install flask-restful`

  ```
- Fix the blueprint (`movie.py`) to consume _flask-restful_:
  ```py
  # remove blueprint because flask-restful will accomplish what we need
  from flask import Response, request
  from database.models import Movie
  # Bring in Resouce from flask_restful
  from flask_restful import Resource

  # Adds a restful class for single movie records (retrieve by id, update, and destroy)
  class MovieApi(Resource):
    # function name is HTTP verb
    # In this class, this will take 2 arguments: (self, id)
    def get(self, id):
      movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id).to_json()
      return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

    def put(self, id):
      body = request.get_json()
      Movie.objects.get(id=id).update(**body)
      return '', 200

    def delete(self, id):
      movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id).delete()
      return '', 200

  # Adds a restful class for all movie records (retrieve all, create new)
  class MoviesApi(Resource):
    # function name is HTTP verb
    # In this class, the argument will be only be (self)
    def get(self):
      movies = Movie.objects().to_json()
      return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

    def post(self):
      body = request.get_json()
      movie =  Movie(**body).save()
      id = movie.id
      return {'id': str(id)}, 200
  ```
- How do we register these endpoints? We will need a new file
  - From directory `resources`
  - `touch routes.py`
  - Add this code:
    ```py
    # Imports from relative file movie.py the classes MovieApi and MoviesApi
    from .movie import MovieApi, MoviesApi

    def initialize_routes(api):
      # Defines the routes for movies that need an id
      api.add_resource(MovieApi, '/movies/<id>')
      # Defines the routes for movies that don't need an id
      api.add_resource(MoviesApi, '/movies')
    ```
- But our runner/index, `app.py`, does not know about these routes yet. Let's update that:
  ```py
  from flask import Flask
  from database.db import initialize_db
  # Import Api package from flask-restful
  from flask_restful import Api
  # Import function initialize_routes from the routes.py file under resources
  from resources.routes import initialize_routes

  app = Flask(__name__)
  # Creates an instance of Api (from flask-restful)
  api = Api(app)

  app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {
    'host': 'mongodb://localhost/practice-api-movies'
  }

  initialize_db(app)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

  # Initializes the routes file as an Api (replaced the blueprint registration of movies)
  initialize_routes(api)

  app.run()
  ```
- SUCCESS! But wait, our URL is... okay. But it doesn't tell a user/client that it is an api or account for versioning. What if we updated our `routes.py` to account for that:
  ```py
  from .movie import MovieApi, MoviesApi

  def initialize_routes(api):
    api.add_resource(MovieApi, '/api/v1/movies/<id>')
    api.add_resource(MoviesApi, '/api/v1/movies')
  ```
- Don't forget to test in Postman (I like to test GET, GET by id, POST, PUT, and DELETE) (it is a great thing I did, because there were a couple typos!! See final code for updates)
  - _Troubleshooting tip: When updating your code, stop and restart server to see affects in Postman_

### Part 4
------

#### Authentication and Authorization
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- Authentication: You are who you say you are
  - Example: _Signing up and Logging into an application_
- Authorization: You are allowed to do the things you are trying to do
  - Example: _An admin is authorized to see all users and delete/update/create users, whereas a user is only authorized to update their own records_

#### Implement Authentication into Our Backend Server
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- Why do we need it?
- Right now, any user with this code can access perform all CRUD functionality. Maybe you want this. Maybe you don't.
- If you need to restrict who has access to CRUD functionality, we need to add authentication so only a logged in user can access CRUD.
- _An example of usage: an unregistered user may be able to access GET all and GET by id, but you may not want them creating, destroying, or updating records unless they have logged in._
- We have a Movie Model, now we need to add a User Model:
- Update `database/models.py`
  ```py
  from .db import db

  # Adds a new model class called User that is a document
  class User(db.Document):
    # Adds an email field that is required and must be unique
    email = db.EmailField(required=True, unique=True)
    # Adds a password field that is required and must be a minimum length of 6 characters
      password = db.StringField(required=True, min_length=6)

  class Movie(db.Document):
    name = db.StringField(required=True, unique=True)
    casts = db.ListField(db.StringField(), required=True)
    genres = db.ListField(db.StringField(), required=True)
  ```
- **WHOA!!** => is it smart to save our password as a string. In essence, that is saving a raw password to the database. SECURITY ALERT! This is bad practice for password/security/safety
- We need to hash our password (converting a password into an encrypted, unreadable, irreversible string of characters/symbols) using bcyrpt, specifically the [flask version](https://flask-bcrypt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- In terminal, run `pipenv install flask-bcrypt`
- Terminal returns
  ```console

  ```
- We need to add bcrypt information to `app.py` (update the top)
  ```py
  from flask import Flask
  # Bring in Bcrypt
  from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
  from database.db import initialize_db
  from flask_restful import Api
  from resources.routes import initialize_routes

  app = Flask(__name__)
  api = Api(app)
  # Apply bcrypt to the app
  bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)
  ```
- Update `models.py` for functions that will generate a password hash and confirm correct password hash
  ```py
  from .db import db
  # Imports bcrypt functions for generating and checking hashes
  from flask_bcrypt import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

  class User(db.Document):
    email = db.EmailField(required=True, unique=True)
    password = db.StringField(required=True, min_length=6)

    # Makes a function that calls self as the argument
    def hash_password(self):
      # For the self object's password, run the hash generator
      self.password = generate_password_hash(self.password).decode('utf8')

    # Makes a function that takes self and password as an argument
    def check_password(self, password):
      # Returns if the password from input patches self.password
      return check_password_hash(self.password, password)

  class Movie(db.Document):
    name = db.StringField(required=True, unique=True)
    casts = db.ListField(db.StringField(), required=True)
    genres = db.ListField(db.StringField(), required=True)
  ```
- Now that we have a User, we also need endpoints for our user, such us _signing up_ or _registering_
  - From directory `resources`
  - Run `touch auth.py`
- Add code to `auth.py`
  ```py
  # We need request from flask
  from flask import request
  # We need User model
  from database.models import User
  # We need Resource for our restful api code
  from flask_restful import Resource

  # Build a new endpoint class
  class SignupApi(Resource):
    # Writes a post endpoint for SignupApi (we still need a route for this)
    def post(self):
      body = request.get_json()
      user = User(**body)
      # ensures password is hashed
      user.hash_password()
      # save the user
      user.save()
      id = user.id
      # returns id as response
      return {'id': str(id)}, 200

  ```
- Now to add that route, update `routes.py`:
  ```py
  from .movie import MovieApi, MoviesApi
  # imports the new class for SignupApi
  from .auth import SignupApi

  def initialize_routes(api):
    api.add_resource(MoviesApi, '/api/v1/movies')
    api.add_resource(MovieApi, '/api/v1/movies/<id>')
    # Adds a route that allows for registration/signing up
    api.add_resource(SignupApi, '/api/v1/auth/signup')
  ```
- TEST time! Go to Postman and test POSTing to http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/signup, then go to Mongo Shell and check Users collection for a hashed password
  - Postman Post Request Check
    - ![Postman POST Request](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103426165-b8951680-4b74-11eb-92a0-f8667c3b3d74.png)
  - Mongo Password Hashing Check
    - For this, I ran:
    - `mongo`
    - `show dbs`
    - `use practice-api-movies`
    - `show collections`
    - `db.user.find().pretty()`

- SIDE QUEST: Need a GUI for your Mongo db interaction? Try [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)
- Okay, so a user can sign up for your application, but can they login as a returning user? AND if they are logged in, how does the application know they are still who they say they are without making them give their email and password every time? **This is where _token-based authentication_ play a large part!**
- For our purposes, we are going to use [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/introduction/), a popular choice for token-based authentication, especially if your code already uses JSON for its data exposure and consumption
- Install by running `pipenv install flask-jwt-extended`

  ```
- For this project, we want to save our user's id as our token, but first it needs to be made secret (with salt - the secret key). We will need the secret key saved somewhere away from codebase, so we will make a `.env` file and give the application access to it (but not a public repo!)
- From root folder, `touch .env`
- In `.env` file, add a key that should be long and hard to guess:
```
JWT_SECRET_KEY = '<your-encryption-key>'
```
  - Having trouble coming up with an encrypted key? You can always try random typing on your keyboard, OR:
  - I like to use this [website](https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/Random/Security-Encryption-Key-Generator.aspx)
  - For this one, I used the `GUID` tab and grabbed a random set, for example `JWT_SECRET_KEY = '786b115a5e2e405fbb72e88d7a8bb335'`
- Since we want to ensure this file is kept off public files, let's go ahead and add a `.gitignore` to the project folder
  - Don't forget to add `.env` to the .gitignore file
  - At this point, we haven't actually initialized git in this project or worked on uploading it to Github, but better safe than sorry!
- Update `app.py` to configure `.env`
  ```py
  from flask import Flask
  from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
  #Imports jwt information
  from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager

  from database.db import initialize_db

  from resources.routes import initialize_routes

  bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)
  # Runs the App throught the JWT manager
  jwt = JWTManager(app)

  app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {
    'host': 'mongodb://localhost/practice-api-movies'
  }

  initialize_db(app)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

  initialize_routes(api)

  app.run()
  ```
- For the above code to work:
  - Mac Terminal: run `export ENV_FILE_LOCATION=./.env`
  - Windows Powershell: run `set ENV_FILE_LOCATION=./.env`
- To finish the login endpoint we need to update `auth.py` and `routes.py`
- `auth.py`
  ```py
  from flask import Response, request
  # bring in token properties
  from flask_jwt_extended import create_access_token
  from database.models import User
  from flask_restful import Resource
  # bring in python datetime
  import datetime

  class SignupApi(Resource):
    def post(self):
      body = request.get_json()
      user = User(**body)
      user.hash_password()
      user.save()
      id = user.id
      return {'id': str(id)}, 200

  # Makes a new class endpoint for Login
  class LoginApi(Resource):
    # Post verb
    def post(self):
      body = request.get_json()
      # Checks the User objects in the data for a user that matches email
      user = User.objects.get(email=body.get('email'))
      # Runs authorization check
      authorized = user.check_password(body.get('password'))
      # If NOT authorized, end function and return error message and status code 401
      if not authorized:
        return {'error': 'Email or password invalid'}, 401

      # Else, if authorized, run the following
      # Create a 7 day time limit (users can't use this token after 7 days)
      expires = datetime.timedelta(days=7)
      # make an access token using JWT, specifically on user.id
      access_token = create_access_token(identity=str(user.id), expires_delta=expires)
      # return the access_token and status of 200
      return {'token': access_token}, 200
  ```
- `routes.py`
  ```py
  from .movie import MovieApi, MoviesApi
  # Also brings in LoginApi class endpoint
  from .auth import SignupApi, LoginApi

  def initialize_routes(api):
    api.add_resource(MoviesApi, '/api/v1/movies')
    api.add_resource(MovieApi, '/api/v1/movies/<id>')
    api.add_resource(SignupApi, '/api/v1/auth/signup')
    # New route for logging in
    api.add_resource(LoginApi, '/api/v1/auth/login')
  ```

#### Implement Authorization into Our Backend Server
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- We will need to update our `movie.py` for safeguards using JWT - only authorized users can Create, Update, and Delete movie records
- `movie.py`
  ```py
  from flask import Response, request
  # Brings in jwt_required package
  from flask_jwt_extended import jwt_required
  from database.models import Movie
  from flask_restful import Resource

  class MovieApi(Resource):
    def get(self, id):
      movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id).to_json()
      return Response(movie, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

    # Requires jwt on this function
    @jwt_required
    def put(self, id):
      body = request.get_json()
      Movie.objects.get(id=id).update(**body)
      return '', 200

    # Requires jwt on this function
    @jwt_required
    def delete(self, id):
      movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id).delete()
      return '', 200

  class MoviesApi(Resource):
    def get(self):
      movies = Movie.objects().to_json()
      return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

    # Requires jwt on this function
    @jwt_required
    def post(self):
      body = request.get_json()
      movie =  Movie(**body).save()
      id = movie.id
      return {'id': str(id)}, 200
  ```
- Test in Postman:
  - We are going to login the user we "signed up". To recall my dummy data was:
    ```json
    {
      "email": "test@user.com",
      "password": "IAmAPassword"
    }
    ```
  - Run the server in terminal, `python app.py`
  - POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/login
  - ![postman login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103431480-9eb3fd80-4b8d-11eb-81bc-c177155b5262.png)
  - If you attempt POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/movies, **Error!**
  - ![postman post error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103431501-fd797700-4b8d-11eb-8617-a65cf0d7e978.png)
  - But if you put Authorization in the headers and grab the token from your login response, you can _NOW_ gain access to POSTing a new movie record!
  - ![success postman post](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103431540-bc359700-4b8e-11eb-8b1b-281fc4dffc0a.png)
- What if I want to restrict update and destroy to only the user who originally created that record?
- Update `models.py` for these restrictions and relationship between movie and user
  ```py
  from .db import db
  from flask_bcrypt import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

  class Movie(db.Document):
    name = db.StringField(required=True, unique=True)
    casts = db.ListField(db.StringField(), required=True)
    genres = db.ListField(db.StringField(), required=True)
    # creates another field which ties the movie to a user
    added_by = db.ReferenceField('User')

  class User(db.Document):
    email = db.EmailField(required=True, unique=True)
    password = db.StringField(required=True, min_length=6)
    # Adds a movies field with datatype List that holds datatypes references (aka - the movie relationship)
    # This also has a reverse_delete_rule, which means that if the movie is deleted from the database, it should also be deleted from this list
    movies = db.ListField(db.ReferenceField('Movie', reverse_delete_rule=db.PULL))

    def hash_password(self):
      self.password = generate_password_hash(self.password).decode('utf8')

    def check_password(self, password):
      return check_password_hash(self.password, password)

  # This creates a delete rule that is a user is deleted, then the movie created by a user is also deleted
  User.register_delete_rule(Movie, 'added_by', db.CASCADE)
  ```
- For this model update to apply, we need to update it the endpoint in `movie.py`
  ```py
  from flask import Response, request
  # Brings in get_jwt_identity()
  from flask_jwt_extended import jwt_required, get_jwt_identity
  # Imports the User model
  from database.models import Movie, User
  from flask_restful import Resource

  class MovieApi(Resource):
    def get(self, id):
      movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id).to_json()
      return Response(movie, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

    @jwt_required
    def put(self, id):
      # gets the token from user
      user_id = get_jwt_identity()
      # Confirms the movie matches the id passed in the URL && that the added_by field matches the user who is "logged in"
      movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id, added_by=user_id)
      body = request.get_json()
      movie.update(**body)
      return '', 200

    @jwt_required
    def delete(self, id):
      # gets the token from user
      user_id = get_jwt_identity()
      # Confirms the movie matches the id passed in the URL && that the added_by field matches the user who is "logged in"
      movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id, added_by=user_id)
      movie.delete()
      return '', 200

  class MoviesApi(Resource):
    def get(self):
      movies = Movie.objects().to_json()
      return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

    @jwt_required
    def post(self):
      # gets the token from user
      user_id = get_jwt_identity()
      body = request.get_json()
      # Grabs the user who matches the jwt identity
      user = User.objects.get(id=user_id)
      # Ensures the new movie record takes the json body data && adds the user to the added_by field
      movie =  Movie(**body, added_by=user)
      movie.save()
      # Adds the new movie to the users movies field
      user.update(push__movies=movie)
      user.save()
      id = movie.id
      return {'id': str(id)}, 200
  ```
- Time to test in Postman and declare success!
  - We need to drop the data from our database and reset it so that our new created records have a user connection for jwt authorization
    - In terminal, run `mongo`
    - `use practice-api-movies` (or whatever your db name is)
    - `db.dropDatabase()`
    - Quit mongo (CTRL + C)
  - I made 2 dummy users, logged in each user and made a dummy movie record with their authorization
    - ![dummy1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103432436-eccffd80-4b9b-11eb-8104-885ebafb1bb7.png)

  - I also checked the movies existed and have the users reference relationship
    - ![confirm users](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103432536-95cb2800-4b9d-11eb-90e8-22e661e12192.png)
  - For dummy user 1:
    - I checked that I could update the record && confirmed with GET that the record updated
    - ![dummy user 1 update movie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103432573-71238000-4b9e-11eb-889f-993c3fcfb4fa.png)
    - Then I checked that I couldn't update movie1 with dummy user 2's authorization
    - Currently this is a 500 error, the next part will cover error handling
    - ![dummy user 2 update movie expected error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103432592-c65f9180-4b9e-11eb-862f-d0bdf55d9dc6.png)

### Part 5
------

#### Custom Error Messages
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- At this point, if we hit an error/issue in Postman, we get a 500 error
- What if we want these errors to be custom and clear? This way clients/users know why they are getting an error (_if a tries to register with an email in the system, they need to be told why they got an error_)
- We are going to use `Exception Handling` and the custom error message ability of `flask-restful`
- Make a new file under `resources` called `errors.py` (Recall a path for CLI would be `cd resources` & `touch errors.py`)
- Add code:
  ```py
  # New Exception classes
  # Exception class for 500 status code with a generic message
  class InternalServerError(Exception):
    pass

  # Exception class for failing to meet the requirements for a record/field/etc
  class SchemaValidationError(Exception):
    pass

  # Exception class for movie already existing
  class MovieAlreadyExistsError(Exception):
    pass

  # Exception class for not having authorization to update a movie record
  class UpdatingMovieError(Exception):
    pass

  # Exception class for not having authorization to delete a movie record
  class DeletingMovieError(Exception):
    pass

  # Exception class for not having a movie by that id
  class MovieNotExistsError(Exception):
    pass

  # Exception class for email already existing in signup process
  class EmailAlreadyExistsError(Exception):
    pass

  # Exception class for incorrect email/password (no distinct difference in error to prevent security breaches [best practice - you should not expose whether it was email or password that was incorrect because this could lead to easier security breaches])
  class UnauthorizedError(Exception):
    pass

  # Errors dictionary that defines the specific message and status code returned for each class of exception handling
  errors = {
    "InternalServerError": {
      "message": "Something went wrong",
      "status": 500
    },
    "SchemaValidationError": {
      "message": "Request is missing required fields",
      "status": 400
    },
    "MovieAlreadyExistsError": {
      "message": "Movie with given name already exists",
      "status": 400
    },
    "UpdatingMovieError": {
      "message": "Updating movie added by other is forbidden",
      "status": 403
    },
    "DeletingMovieError": {
      "message": "Deleting movie added by other is forbidden",
      "status": 403
    },
    "MovieNotExistsError": {
      "message": "Movie with given id doesn't exists",
      "status": 400
    },
    "EmailAlreadyExistsError": {
      "message": "User with given email address already exists",
      "status": 400
    },
    "UnauthorizedError": {
      "message": "Invalid username or password",
      "status": 401
    }
  }
  ```
- Since we have `flask-restful` which gives us an Api Class, we need to update it to accept errors
- Update `app.py`
  ```py
  from flask import Flask
  from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
  from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager

  from database.db import initialize_db
  from flask_restful import Api
  from resources.routes import initialize_routes
  # Bring in errors dictionary (a datatype that is like hashes in ruby) that defines the classes of exception handling
  from resources.errors import errors

  app = Flask(__name__)
  app.config.from_envvar('ENV_FILE_LOCATION')

  # Add errors to the api class
  api = Api(app, errors=errors)
  bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)
  jwt = JWTManager(app)

  app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {
    'host': 'mongodb://localhost/practice-api-movies'
  }

  initialize_db(app)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

  initialize_routes(api)

  app.run()
  ```
- At this point, we have built out errors and applied them to the api class, but our endpoints don't have information or logic surrounding the error handling, so, let's update `movie.py`
  ```py
  from flask import Response, request
  from flask_jwt_extended import jwt_required, get_jwt_identity
  from database.models import Movie, User
  from flask_restful import Resource
  # Pulls in errors that are native to mongoengine
  from mongoengine.errors import FieldDoesNotExist, NotUniqueError, DoesNotExist, ValidationError, InvalidQueryError
  # Pulls in custom erros we created in resources/errors.py
  from resources.errors import SchemaValidationError, MovieAlreadyExistsError, InternalServerError, UpdatingMovieError, DeletingMovieError, MovieNotExistsError

  class MovieApi(Resource):
    def get(self, id):
      # Python `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors
        # The `except` block will let you handle the error
        # The `else` block will execute if no errors raised
        # The `finally` block lets you execute code no matter the result of try and except
      # This tests the code we originally had here, none of the endpoint code was changed
      try:
        movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id).to_json()
        return Response(movie, mimetype="application/json", status=200)
      # If the record does not exist
      except DoesNotExist:
        # Returns custom error that the movie does not exist
        raise MovieNotExistsError
      # There are a few different except final statemtents:
        # except: will catch everything
        # except Exception: does not catch BaseException
        # except BaseException: will catch the baseexception, like just except
        # except Exception as e: will catch what you are "meant" to catch and gives you access to the attributes of the exception object
      # Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18982610/difference-between-except-and-except-exception-as-e-in-python
      # Catches exceptions EXCLUDING base (keyboard interrupt, system exit, etc)
      except Exception:
        # Returns custom 500 error
        raise InternalServerError

    @jwt_required
    def put(self, id):
      # Checks code for errors
      try:
        user_id = get_jwt_identity()
        movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id, added_by=user_id)
        body = request.get_json()
        movie.update(**body)
        return '', 200
      # If you query the incorrect record (wrong id number)
      except InvalidQueryError:
        # Then raise the custom schema error from the errors dictionary
        raise SchemaValidationError
      # If the record does not exist
      except DoesNotExist:
        # Raises updating movie error. Why? Is this because if an unauthorized user attempts to update a movie it will return as if the record doesn't exist?
        raise UpdatingMovieError
      # Catches exceptions EXCLUDING base (keyboard interrupt, system exit, etc)
      except Exception:
        # Returns custom 500 error
        raise InternalServerError

    @jwt_required
    def delete(self, id):
      # Checks code for errors
      try:
        user_id = get_jwt_identity()
        movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id, added_by=user_id)
        movie.delete()
        return '', 200
      # If the record does not exist
      except DoesNotExist:
        # Return custom delete error. This makes sense now that if an unauthorized user attempts to access the record, it will show as if it doesn't exist becasue movie is only collected if it belongs to the user_id
        raise DeletingMovieError
      # Catches exceptions EXCLUDING base (keyboard interrupt, system exit, etc)
      except Exception:
        # Returns custom 500 error
        raise InternalServerError

    def get(self):
      movies = Movie.objects().to_json()
      return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)

        # Then raise the custom schema error from the errors dictionary
        raise SchemaValidationError

        raise MovieAlreadyExistsError
      # Catches excpected exceptions and gives us access to attributes of exception object saved as variable e (why would we use this here? seems excessive, but perhaps more is coming later in the tutorial?)
      except Exception as e:
        # Returns custom 500 error
        raise InternalServerError
  ```
- Woo! We've made a lot of progress on exception handling. Let's check what else we need to update

#### Auth and Error Handling
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- At this point, we:
  - `resources/errors.py`: made an errors file
  - `app.py`: updated app to accept errors
  - `resources/movie.py`: updated our endpoints for returning errors using try/except blocks
- If we check our remaining files, we can check what files will still need to be updated to finalize error handling:
  - `resources/auth.py`: this creates 2 endpoint classes for users, signing up and logging in. **Since these endpoints will also need to return errors, we will need to update this file!**
  - hidden files `.gitignore` and `.env` don't need to be updated
  - `database/db.py`: this initializes the database, I don't believe this needs updates for error handling
  - `database/models.py`: this defines our models/documents in the database, I don't believe this needs updates for error handling
  - `resources/routes.py`: this defines our urls for each endpoint class, I don't believe this needs updates for error handling
- Update `auth.py`:

### Part 6
------
#### Flask Mail
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- What happens if a registered user forgets their password? The easiest and most common method of password resetting is an email flow:
  - (1) The user/client selects the link for a password reset
  - (2) That link sends an email back to the user/client with a `reset_token`
  - (3) The user/client clicks a link in the email that takes them to a reset page that takes their reset token and a new password
  - (4) Success email is sent to client stating their password was recently updated
- We already have the `flask-jwt-extended` library (from Part 4: Authentication and Authorization), which has a native ability to generate `password reset tokens`
- But to send the `password reset tokens` we need an email client, we will use [Flask Mail](https://pythonhosted.org/flask-mail/)
- Run in the terminal, `pipenv install flask-mail`
- My terminals response
  ```console

  ```
- Time to update our code, starting with registering our mail server with our app: `app.py`
  ```py
  from flask import Flask
  from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
  from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager
  # import the Mail object from flask_mail
  from flask_mail import Mail

  from database.db import initialize_db
  from flask_restful import Api
  from resources.routes import initialize_routes
  from resources.errors import errors

  app = Flask(__name__)
  app.config.from_envvar('ENV_FILE_LOCATION')

  api = Api(app, errors=errors)
  bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)
  jwt = JWTManager(app)
  # Run our app through the Mail object
  mail = Mail(app)

  app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {
    'host': 'mongodb://localhost/practice-api-movies'
  }

  initialize_db(app)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

  initialize_routes(api)

  app.run()
  ```
- We need a Service for send an email to our user/client:
  - `mkdir services`
  - `cd services`
  - `touch mail_service.py`
- Add code to `mail_service.py`:
  ```py
  # Imports threading function from Thread (a thread is a seperate flow of execution)
  from threading import Thread
  # We want to access flask_mail to send an email
  from flask_mail import Message

  # Bring in our app from app.py
  from app import app
  # Bring in our mail object from app.py
  from app import mail

  # The function that will be called in a seperate thread
  def send_async_email(app, msg):
    # Use app_context() in a with block, and everything that runs in the block will have access to current_app (source: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/appcontext/)
    with app.app_context():
      # run code while checking for errors
      try:
        # Send the mail object through the service
        mail.send(msg)
      # If the service connection is refused
      except ConnectionRefusedError:
        # return the error message in string
        raise InternalServerError("[MAIL SERVER] not working")

  # creates a function that has args: subject, sender, recipients, text_body and html_body
  def send_email(subject, sender, recipients, text_body, html_body):
    # Creates a message object with subject, sender and recipient from arguments
    msg = Message(subject, sender=sender, recipients=recipients)
    # creates message body from text_body arg
    msg.body = text_body
    # creates message html from html_body arg
    msg.html = html_body
    # Runs a seperate thread for send_async_email
      # WHY? It can take a while for emails to relay through outside services like Google and Yahoo
      # The threading method allows us to tell the user/client that their email was sent sent while the actual act of sending is happening on a different thread so that it doesn't prevent load times (aka, )
    Thread(target=send_async_email, args=(app, msg)).start()
  ```
- We still need to expose endpoints for the password reset: a forgot endpoint and a reset endpoint
- In `resources`, `touch reset_password.py` Add the following code:
  ```py
  # Bring in request and render functions from Flask
  from flask import request, render_template
  # Bring in token functions from JWT
  from flask_jwt_extended import create_access_token, decode_token
  # Bring in our own User model
  from database.models import User
  # Bring in Resource object from Flask-restful
  from flask_restful import Resource
  # Bring in datetime for Python
  import datetime
  # Bring in my custom errors (INCLUDING 2 THAT DON'T EXIST QUITE YET!!)
  from resources.errors import SchemaValidationError, InternalServerError, EmailDoesnotExistsError, BadTokenError
  # Bring in JWT native exceptions
  from jwt.exceptions import ExpiredSignatureError, DecodeError, InvalidTokenError
  # Bring send_email function from our mail_service.py
  from services.mail_service import send_email

  # New API endpoint class and resource for Forgot password
  class ForgotPassword(Resource):
    # POST http verb
    def post(self):
      # takes the requests url and attaches 'reset/' onto the end
      url = request.host_url + 'reset/'
      # Run code block while checking for errors
      try:
        # Gets request body in json format
        body = request.get_json()
        # Gets the user/client email from the body
        email = body.get('email')
        # If an email doesn't come through
        if not email:
          # Return an error that says missing field
          raise SchemaValidationError

        # OTHERWISE: Check database for a user by that email
        user = User.objects.get(email=email)
        # If that email isn't in database
        if not user:
          # Return custom error that user is not in system
          raise EmailDoesnotExistsError

        # OTHERWISE: set up a time limit of 24 hours
        expires = datetime.timedelta(hours=24)
        # And create a reset token
        reset_token = create_access_token(str(user.id), expires_delta=expires)

        # Return the function send_email (from our mail_service) with the following arguments
        # This actually sends the email to the user/client with their reset_token (in url)
        # Has a .txt format for the email body && a .html format information
        return send_email('[Movie-bag] Reset Your Password',

        password = body.get('password')

        # If reset_token or password not provided

- We imported 2 errors from our custom `errors.py` file that don't exist yet. Let's fix that:

  class UnauthorizedError(Exception):
    pass

  # NEW Exception class for email not existing
  class EmailDoesnotExistsError(Exception):
    pass

  # NEW Exception class for a token being invalid
  class BadTokenError(Exception):
    pass

  ```
-  Recall that in our `reset_password.py` file, we called upon _templates_. Let's make those now:
  - From root folder: `mkdir templates`
  - `cd templates`
  - `mkdir email`
  - `cd email`
  - `touch reset_password.html`
  - `touch reset_password.txt`
- Add code to `reset_password.html`:
  ```html
  <!-- HTML filetype -->
  <!-- This is the email template that a user would see -->
  <p>Dear, User</p>
  <p>
      To reset your password
      <!-- This comes from the `render_template()` which is a flask function we are using in reset_password.py -->
      <a href="{{ url }}">
          click here
      </a>.
  </p>
  <p>Alternatively, you can paste the following link in your browser's address bar:</p>
  <p>{{ url }}</p>
  <p>If you have not requested a password reset simply ignore this message.</p>

- Add code to `reset_password.txt`:
  ```txt
  Dear, User

  To reset your password click on the following link:

  {{ url }}

  If you have not requested a password reset simply ignore this message.

  Sincerely

  Movie-bag Support Team
  ```
- Yay! We still need api urls in our `routes.py` file:
  ```py
  from .movie import MovieApi, MoviesApi
  from .auth import SignupApi, LoginApi
  # Bring in function of forgot and reset from our reset_password.py file
  from .reset_password import ForgotPassword, ResetPassword

  def initialize_routes(api):
    api.add_resource(MoviesApi, '/api/v1/movies')
    api.add_resource(MovieApi, '/api/v1/movies/<id>')
    api.add_resource(SignupApi, '/api/v1/auth/signup')
    api.add_resource(LoginApi, '/api/v1/auth/login')
    # add api url for forgot password
    api.add_resource(ForgotPassword, '/api/v1/auth/forgot')
    # add api url for reset password
    api.add_resource(ResetPassword, '/api/v1/auth/reset')
  ```
- Try running your server (`python app.py`) and see below

#### A New Runner
[Table of Contents](#priyas-practice)
- **EXPECTED ERROR!**: we get an import error from our `reset_password.py` file. This is due to a circular dependency problem in Python. See below
  ```
  In our reset_password.py,
  we import send_mail,
  which, in turn, is importing app from app.py,
  whereas app is not yet defined on our app.py
  ```
- ![circular dependency](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--AMza29ql--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3ymtwfv8cdeyc9t57bgh.png)
- To fix this, we need to create a seperate "runner" file that is distinct from our `app.py`. Again we are hitting on why SRP is important. Currently, our `app.py` file is handling too much responsibility, so let's refactor
- `touch run.py`
  ```py
  # bring in the app from our app.py file
  from app import app

  # Run the app
  app.run()
  ```
- And let's correct our `app.py`
  ```py
  from flask import Flask
  from flask_bcrypt import Bcrypt
  from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager
  from flask_mail import Mail

  from database.db import initialize_db
  from flask_restful import Api
  # We removed the routes import from this line (it is moved below, order of operations issue?)
  from resources.errors import errors

  app = Flask(__name__)
  app.config.from_envvar('ENV_FILE_LOCATION')
  # This object was moved up
  mail = Mail(app)

  # Brings in the routes, which are now underneath mail, this might be how we solve this order of operations (or circular dependency)
  from resources.routes import initialize_routes

  api = Api(app, errors=errors)
  bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)
  jwt = JWTManager(app)

  app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {
    'host': 'mongodb://localhost/practice-api-movies'
  }

  @app.route('/')
  def hello():
    return {'hello': 'world'}

  initialize_db(app)
  initialize_routes(api)

  # removes app.run()
  ```
- We need some new configurations in `.env`
  ```c
  JWT_SECRET_KEY = '<your-chosen-encrypted-key>'
  MAIL_SERVER = "<server-name>"
  MAIL_PORT = "<mail-port>"
  MAIL_USERNAME = "support@<project-name>.com"
  MAIL_PASSWORD = ""

  // For my project
  JWT_SECRET_KEY = 'ksjdhfiw84y5934ihgkjvhos9e785984owhfksj'
  MAIL_SERVER = "localhost"
  MAIL_PORT = "1025"
  MAIL_USERNAME = "support@practice-api-movies.com"
  MAIL_PASSWORD = ""
  ```
- We are going to go through the motions of testing this new functionality, so first, let's get a clean database:
  - I opened `mongo` in terminal
  - Then `use practice-api-movies` (the name of my database)
  - Finally `db.dropDatabase()`
- We will need to start a SMTP server (the machine that takes care of the whole email delivery process) in our terminal
- **In a _seperate_ terminal tab, still in the project directory**, run `python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025`
- In your main terminal tab under project directory, run your backend server with `python run.py` (**NOTICE:** you are no longer running `app.py`)
- Test this in Postman
  - Have a dummy user who is registered
  - **POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/signup**
  ```json
  {
    "email": "testingpassword@user.com",
    "password": "PassPassPass"
  }
  ```
  - ![Dummy user creation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103447488-37f41a00-4c49-11eb-854a-b8fc2593baf5.png)
  - Access the forgot endpoint
  - **POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/forgot**
  ```json
  {
    "email": "testingpassword@user.com"
  }
  ```
  - ![Forgot endpoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103447503-5eb25080-4c49-11eb-87d3-eca080afdb8c.png)
  - Check your `SMTP terminal` => do you see the email that is sent to the user? It even includes the `reset_token`
  - ![SMTP Terminal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103447577-53135980-4c4a-11eb-8ca2-cfdd75ec63f6.png)
  - Copy the `reset_token` (_front-end code would have implementation to grab this automatically_) and use it in the reset endpoint
  - **POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/reset**
  ```json
  {
    "password": "NEWPassword",
    "reset_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE2MDk1NDE1MzgsIm5iZiI6MTYwOTU0MTUzOCwianRpIjoiNzI2ZjE4NjQtZDY3MC00MTQ5LWJhZjEtOWM4YmQ2MzRlODJjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjA5NjI3OTM4LCJpZGVudGl0eSI6IjVmZWZhNzJlMjJhNWI0MzFjY2NmZDM0MSIsImZyZXNoIjpmYWxzZSwidHlwZSI6ImFjY2VzcyJ9.eSzkzMIMDvDufSENTNGRWCisRu6jqMBmpcs2TrUOqIQ"
  }
  ```
  - ![Reset endpoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103447602-a08fc680-4c4a-11eb-9b71-bbd991e29ba1.png)
  - If you had used a real email, you can test that it sends a final email stating the password was reset successfully
  - Confirm password did change by logging in
  - **POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/auth/login**
  ```json
  {
    "email": "testingpassword@user.com",
    "password": "NEWPassword"
  }
  ```
  - ![Confirm new password](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103447628-f6fd0500-4c4a-11eb-9f41-a954a1ecffa4.png)
  - Great job. Enjoy this tiger eating a zebra for your hard work
