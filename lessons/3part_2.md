#### Setup
  - Following [this tutorial](https://dev.to/paurakhsharma/flask-rest-api-part-0-setup-basic-crud-api-4650)
  - Create your project folder/directory: `mkdir practice_api_movies`
  - `cd practice_api_movies`
  - Create a new virtual environment
  - Successful installation of pipenv, includes errors
    - tried `pip install --user pipenv`, error = 'no command pip'
    - tried `pip3 install --user pipenv` and got a correct sequence, however, could not use `pipenv` still
    - Finally tried `sudo -H pip install -U pipenv` ([source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46391721/pipenv-command-not-found))
  - Use `pipenv install flask` to install flask
  - The following prints out
      ```console
      Creating a virtualenv for this project...

      To activate this project's virtualenv, run pipenv shell.
      Alternatively, run a command inside the virtualenv with pipenv run.
      ```
  - There should be **2** new files in your project directory, `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` (confirmed)
  - My `Pipfile` contains the packages (**flask** package is on ln 7) - which means if someone else downloads this code and uses `pipenv install` they should get **flask** as well, similar to a `requirements.txt` file:
      ```console
      [[source]]
      url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
      verify_ssl = true
      name = "pypi"

      [packages]
      flask = "*"

      [dev-packages]

      [requires]
      python_version = "3.9"
      ```

- #### Get your Root endpoint Exposed
  - Make a file for our rest api: `touch app.py`
  - Code for the app file:
      ```python
      # imports the flask class from the flask package
      from flask import Flask

      app = Flask(__name__)

      # Defines the root endpoint (@app.route == decorator)
      @app.route('/')
      # When '/' endpoint is called, it returns this function, hello()
      def hello():
          # which returns {'hello': 'world'}
          return {'hello': 'world'}

      # This line starts the flask server
      app.run()
      ```
  - To **RUN** the app, you first enable the virtual environment with `pipenv shell`
  - Response:
      ```console
      /Users/priyapower/Coding/learning/python/practice_api_movies  $üêßpipenv shell
        Launching subshell in virtual environment...
          . /Users/priyapower/.local/share/virtualenvs/practice_api_movies-8EKfv0js/bin/activate
      /Users/priyapower/Coding/learning/python/practice_api_movies  $üêß
        . /Users/priyapower/.local/share/virtualnvs/practice_api_movies-8EKfv0js/bin/activate
      (practice_api_movies) /Users/priyapower/Coding/learning/python/practice_api_movies  $üêß
      ```
  - Run with `python app.py`
  - Response:
      ```console
      * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
      * Environment: production
       WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
       Use a production WSGI server instead.
      * Debug mode: off
      * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
      ```
  - Checked at http://localhost:5000 OR http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  - Confirmed site response was `{'hello': 'world'}`
  - Yay! Everything is up an running

- #### Let's get an index of movies returned
  - Time to update our `app.py` "runner" file:
      ```python
      # Imports jsonify from flask package. This converts our data into proper JSON responses
      from flask import Flask, jsonify

      app = Flask(__name__)

      #  creates a data set called movie which is an array. Each element in the array represents a movie data record that is a hash/dict datatype. Name datatype is string. Casts and Genres datatypes are arrays of strings.
      movies = [
          {
              "name": "The Shawshank Redemption",
              "casts": ["Tim Robbins", "Morgan Freeman", "Bob Gunton", "William Sadler"],
              "genres": ["Drama"]
          },
          {
             "name": "The Godfather ",
             "casts": ["Marlon Brando", "Al Pacino", "James Caan", "Diane Keaton"],
             "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"]
          }
      ]

      # Updates the endpoint beyond just / and now has a declared endpoint /movies
      @app.route('/movies')
      def hello():
          # returns the JSON version of the movie data set from line 7
          return jsonify(movies)

      app.run()
      ```
  - Tested at http://127.0.0.1:5000/movies and http://localhost:5000/movies
    - From this point, all testing will be done directly through localhost since 127.0.0.1 represents localhost
  - Now that we know our endpoint is exposing data correctly and through JSON, time to check it with **Postman**
  ![Get on Postman](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103389126-2e907380-4aca-11eb-8949-9ea100449747.png)
  - Woo! It works

- #### CRUD - It's what you do
  - Time to work on that CRUD (create, read, update, and destroy, see this [article](https://trendintech.com/2018/01/19/why-is-crud-so-important-in-computer-programming/) for more information on CRUD)
  - Updates to code:
      ```python
      # Imports request object from flask, see here(https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/reqcontext/)
      from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

      app = Flask(__name__)

      @app.route('/')
      def hello():
          return {'hello': 'world'}

      # This is called a list in python (array in ruby/js)
      movies = [
          {
              "name": "The Shawshank Redemption",
              "casts": ["Tim Robbins", "Morgan Freeman", "Bob Gunton", "William Sadler"],
              "genres": ["Drama"]
          },
          {
             "name": "The Godfather ",
             "casts": ["Marlon Brando", "Al Pacino", "James Caan", "Diane Keaton"],
             "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"]
          }
      ]

      @app.route('/movies')
      def get_all_movies():
          return jsonify(movies)

      # CREATE
      # @app.route can take 2 arguments, the first being the endpoint, the second is the API verb (get, post, put, delete, etc). I assume without the second arg, the default is GET since the beginning of this tutorial worked :)
      @app.route('/movies', methods=['POST'])
      # New method/function name
      def add_movie():
          # set block variable movie equal to the json input (from user/client)
          movie = request.get_json()
          # Takes the movies list(what I know as array from ruby) from line 10 and adds an item (in this case, the block variable movie which has saved the user/client input in json format) to end of the list (https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/append)
          movies.append(movie)
          # returns dict/hash of id which is set to calling the length of the list (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp) && returns a status code of 200 - successful
          return {'id': len(movies)}, 200

      # UPDATE
      # endpoint now has an integer index value it is assuming exists in the list
      @app.route('/movies/<int:index>', methods=['PUT'])
      def update_movie(index):
          movie = request.get_json()
          # replaces what is saved at the index value with the information from user/client input
          movies[index] = movie
          # returns the json version of the record at that index spot && status code 200
          return jsonify(movies[index]), 200

      # DESTROY
      @app.route('/movies/<int:index>', methods=['DELETE'])
      def delete_movie(index):
          #  removes element at index (https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_list_pop.asp)
          movies.pop(index)
          # returns an string of none with 200 status code
          return 'None', 200

      app.run()
      ```

- #### Test CRUD out with Postman
  - Create/Post:
    - Post verb
    - Body tab = raw & JSON
    - Put user/client info for a NEW movie record in the body input section
    - Hit Send
    - VOILA! - You can confirm with /movies as a GET to see all 3 movie records
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103389125-2e907380-4aca-11eb-9f11-c0c748ada3b8.png)
  - Update/Put:
    - Put verb
    - Body tab = raw & JSON
    - Paste new info
    - Hit send
    - **ERROR** - I attempted to do /movies/3, since there are 3 records, however, it is technically id=2 because it begins at 0. Is there a discrepancy in the code? Why does POST show id=3?
    - VOILA!
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103389124-2df7dd00-4aca-11eb-8eb4-41ebb4b3fa2f.png)
  - Destroy/Delete:
    - Ensure correct id in endpoint uri
    - Delete verb
    - Hit send
    - VOILA!
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49959312/103389122-2d5f4680-4aca-11eb-99d0-0f3abee0cf08.png)

- #### Installing Mongodb and Understanding the library we will use
  - The docs for installing on [mac](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
  - Prereqs: xcode command-line & homebrew
  - "Tap" the homebrew mongodb by running `brew tap mongodb/brew`
  - My terminals output:
  ```console
  ==> Tapping mongodb/brew
  Cloning into '/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/mongodb/homebrew-brew'...
  remote: Enumerating objects: 1, done.
  remote: Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.

  Resolving deltas: 100% (238/238), done.
  Tapped 11 formulae (39 files, 179.2KB).
  ```
  - We need to download the community edition, so first check system reqs by running `brew tap | grep mongodb`
  - I confirmed in my terminal that I see `mongodb/brew`
  - Install the community edition (latest version is at 4.4) by running `brew install mongodb-community@4.4`
  - See lots of output including:
  ```console
  ==> Installing mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
  ==> Caveats
  To have launchd start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community now and restart at login:
    brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
  Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
    mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
  ==> Summary
  üç∫  /usr/local/Cellar/mongodb-community/4.4.3: 11 files, 156.8MB, built in 4 seconds
  ```
  - Popular Libraries:
    - [Pymongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) - connects Mongo and Python
      - Allows you to use the schemaless nature of MongoDB
    - [MongoEngine](http://docs.mongoengine.org) - creates a _document_ based schema that connects Python and Mongo
      - This will **restrict** our access to the schemaless nature of MongoDB
      - We will utilize an extension for flask called [Flask-MongoEngine](http://docs.mongoengine.org/projects/flask-mongoengine/en/latest/)
  - Installing the libraries and the Flask extension
    - Since MongoEngine relies on PyMongo, if you [install](http://docs.mongoengine.org/guide/installing.html) engine, it brings pymongo along with it
    - And guess what?? Since flask-mongoengine relies on mongoengine, when you install flask you get mongoengine!
    - So we really only need to start with the extension since the rest come with it
    - Run `pipenv install flask-mongoengine`
    - To confirm pymongo installed, I ran `pip freeze | grep pymongo`, which returned `pymongo==3.11.2`
    - To confirm mongoengine installed, I ran `pip freeze | grep mongoengine` , which returned `mongoengine==0.22.1`
    - To confirm the extension installed, I ran `pip freeze | grep flask-mongoengine` , which returned `flask-mongoengine==1.0.0`

- #### Getting started with the database
  - First we begin my updating our file tree
    - `mkdir database`
    - `cd database`
    - `touch db.py`
    - `touch models.py`
  - We need to activate the database
    - Inside `db.py`, add the following code:
    ```py
    # imports flask_mongoengine from mongoengine
    from flask_mongoengine import MongoEngine
    # sets a variable called db to the engine
    db = MongoEngine()
    # Function will initialize the database using the app (app.py) as its arg
    def initialize_db(app):
      # initializes the database with the app
        db.init_app(app)
    ```
  - We need to add a Movie model
    - Inside `models.py`, add the following code:
    ```py
    # This is a 'document'
    # This defines the schema and users/clients cannot work outside these constraints
    from .db import db
    # Makes a Movie document
    class Movie(db.Document):
        # has three fields
        # name is a string datatype that is required and must be unique
        name = db.StringField(required=True, unique=True)
        # casts is a list datatype; has a subfield of string that is required
        casts = db.ListField(db.StringField(), required=True)
        # genres is a list datatype; has a subfield of string that is required
        genres = db.ListField(db.StringField(), required=True)
    ```

- #### Connect your database with your app
  - Update  `app.py` to use the database and not hardcoded data && change the view functions
  ```py
  # remove jsonify from flask imports and add a Response import
  from flask import Flask, request, Response
  # Brings in the function we just wrote in db.py
  from database.db import initialize_db
  # Brings in the class (document) we just wrote in models.py
  from database.models import Movie
  app = Flask(__name__)
  # Sets up configuration for mongodb
  app.config['MONGODB_SETTINGS'] = {
      # declare the host in the format <host-url>/<database-name> (see http://docs.mongoengine.org/projects/flask-mongoengine/en/latest/#configuration)
      'host': 'mongodb://localhost/movie-bag'
  }
  # initialize the database
  initialize_db(app)
  @app.route('/movies')
  def get_movies():
      # calls all the objects from the Movie document & converts to json
      movies = Movie.objects().to_json()
      # returns a response object, response type is defined as application/json
      return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)
  @app.route('/movies', methods=['POST'])
  def add_movie():
      # gets the json from the body in post
      body = request.get_json()
      # loads the Movie document with the fields in the request
      # the ** is a spread operator (in this case it will spread the dict object)
      # After it will save
      movie =  Movie(**body).save()
      # block variable id is set to movie.id
      id = movie.id
      # returns block variable of string of the id and status 200
      return {'id': str(id)}, 200
  @app.route('/movies/<id>', methods=['PUT'])
  def update_movie(id):
      body = request.get_json()
      # First get the movie object by id, THEN update with spread
      Movie.objects.get(id=id).update(**body)
      # Returns empty string and 200 status
      return '', 200
  @app.route('/movies/<id>', methods=['DELETE'])
  def delete_movie(id):
      # First get the movie object by id, THEN delete
      movie = Movie.objects.get(id=id).delete()
      return '', 200
  app.run()
  ```
- #### Make our API endpoints more robust
  - We forgot a CRUD endpoint. We have Create (Post), Read/Retrieve (GET), Update (Put), and Destroy (Delete). HOWEVER, Read/Retrieve technically has 2! GET single movie (in rails this is Show) and GET all movies (in rails this is Index). We are missing our GET single (get by id)
  - Add the following _above_ `app.run()`
  ```py
  @app.route('/movies/<id>')
  def get_movie(id):
      movies = Movie.objects.get(id=id).to_json()
      return Response(movies, mimetype="application/json", status=200)
  ```

- #### Connect seeds file for testing
  - [source](https://github.com/pkosiec/mongo-seeding)
- #### Run the server and test in Postman
  - If you are outside of the virtual environment, first run `pipenv shell`
  - Otherwise, just run `python app.py`
  - If there are no typos, you should see your server start
