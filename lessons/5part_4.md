The Dream Home team won second place at our event demo competition! Dream Home is an application that provides first-time homebuyers with the financial awareness needed to start their home buying journey. Users can ask questions such as how much home they can afford, and how long it would take them to reach their financial goal each tailored to their current financial forecast. Our final report provides nine unique savings plans that the user can select from. Each depends on how fast the user can achieve the original down payment that takes into account their financial forecast. This still delivers a path forward in monthly payments to realistically achieve this purchase.
